Project Plan
--------

Project Title: DE2Pac Synthesizer


Provide a one paragraph description of your project:

DE2Pac is a basic synthesizer that will allow the user to create sounds from two oscillator sources and configure modulations to specific parameters using an ADSR envelope.
A basic UI will be displayed on the VGA out, showing the user the current state of the synthesizer as well as their current selections.
The user will be able to select the current module (oscillator A, oscillator B, ASDR envelope) and the current parameter (oscillator A => wave, oscillator A => volume, etc) using the switches on the DE2 board.
The user then can configure the value for the selected parameter using switches.
The user then applies and stores the currently selected value using a key.

In terms of team structure our group of four will divide up the responsibilities of the project into two "squads" of two:
Squad A will be responsible for setting up core synthesizer functionality which includes
- PS2 keyboard input (acts as our piano keyboard which we use to input the notes to play)
- Oscillators (x2) used to generate the sound (square, sine, saw, triangle)
- ASDR envelope (x1) used to control the volume of the sound overtime as it gets played. The envelope will have 4 preset configurations that the user can select between.

Squad B is responsible for setting up the VGA view layer of the synthesizer. 
They will create areas on the screen showing the current state for the following modules:
- Oscillators (x2)
- ADSR envelope (x1)
Each module box will have selection outlines that toggle to indicate if they are currently selected or not based off the current switch inputs.



What is your plan for the first week?
Squad A:
Write some code to get the audio controller to play some basic notes/tones.

Squad B: 
Get the drawing of the basic module shapes (i.e. a hollow rectangle) as well as some letters/words.



What is your plan for the second week?
Squad A:
Have oscillator and ADSR envelopes built. Have them hooked up and working with switches and keys and the PS2 keyboard.

Squad B: 
Have oscillator and ASDR envelope modules display on the VGA output and have selections highlights changed based off hardcoded test inputs (there is no communication with the core synthesizer yet).



What is your plan for the third week?

Squad A/Squad B:
Integrate the core synthesizer with the VGA display system and get the project in a demoable state.



What is your backup plan if things donâ€™t work out as planned?

If squad A starts falling behind we will drop the ADSR envelope module and solely work on the oscillator module. 

If squad B starts falling behind, we will drop the ADSR envelope module and use the extra time squad A gains to help squad B get everything working (notice that since the ASDR envelope module is dropped, less work will be needed to be done for squad B as a result).


Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>


[This is an example of a report where things didn't go so well.]
Week 1: 
We have designs for what the VGA should display, and what inputs it will be given and what outputs it will send to the display. We worked on getting the VGA Module up and running but we're running into many roadblocks. We discovered that characters can be drawn on the vga using a bitmap
We can indicate which pixels of the n x m space assigned to a character should be colored by assigning a value of 1 to them. (This idea came from char_decoder.v
from notepad--). We talked to Mickey to see if he could help us out and he suggested that we try to find a vga adapter that's more sophisticated than the one we're using in class, but we can't find any. We might have to scale down to using some of the built-in DE2 LCD or Hex displays. We're going to the makerspace tomorrow to see if we can make some more progress.
